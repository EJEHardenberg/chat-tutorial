This is the source code for a tutorial on [my website]. The tutorial is 
broken into three parts. 

- [Part One]: Introduction, Architecture, Internal C Function 
- Part Two: Using qdecoder, creating the Web facing API (not released yet)
- Part Three: Creating the Web Interface to the Chat Server (not released yet)

Also, I will be tagging the ending commits of each tutorial so it is easy to 
look through the commit timeline and view the project at different points in time.

Once you've cloned the repository you can use

    git tag -l

to view the list of tags and then `checkout tags/<name>` to switch to that tag.
